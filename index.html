      <h2>üîê Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div class="legal-content">
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines how WavyBot collects, uses, and protects your data.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>WavyBot collects only the data strictly necessary for its functionality, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discord User IDs:</strong> To identify users for moderation actions, command usage, and personalized features (e.g., leveling system). These are stored encrypted.</li>
          <li><strong>Discord Guild (Server) IDs:</strong> To store server-specific configurations (e.g., logging channels, anti-raid settings) and track bot presence.</li>
          <li><strong>Discord Channel IDs:</strong> For setting up specific channels for logs, welcome messages, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Message Content:</strong> Temporarily processed for command parsing, anti-raid detection, and moderation logs. Message content is NOT stored unless explicitly required for a specific bot feature (like suggestion logs, which would be visible to your server staff) and is always anonymized where possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Bot-related Settings:</strong> Configurations set by server administrators (e.g., enable/disable features, thresholds, custom messages).</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Storing and applying server-specific configurations.</li>
          <li>Internal analytics to improve bot performance and identify common issues (anonymous).</li>
          <li>Responding to support requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Storage & Security</h3>
        <p>All data is stored securely using industry-standard practices. We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Data is stored on secure servers located [mention rough region if known, e.g., "in North America"]. Data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the bot's services or as required by law.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
